We recommend using Flutter Version 3.27.3+

1. In the Example application folder, install packages first.

   ```bash
   cd packages/abc_bloc_inspector/example
   flutter pub get
   dart run build_runner build watch
   ```

2. Run Example application.

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. Run DevTools
    ```bash
    dart devtools
    ```

4. Connect Example application with DevTools
   - When you run application(STEP2), you'll see a message in your terminal that looks like the following:
      ```
